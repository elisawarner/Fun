# Utilities README

**Author:** Elisa Warner  

## Description:
This repository contains some code I made for fun that practices recursion. There is also another code that takes random subsets of large databases.

## Files Included:
* `determinant.py` : calculates determinant of a NxN matrix
* `factorial.py` : calculates the factorial of any value
* `random_sub.py` : extracts a random subset from any file, large or small.
